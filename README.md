# Churn-Prediction-Model
This project builds a customer churn prediction model using Python and bank customer data, applying five different machine learning algorithms â€” Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Classifier â€” to compare their performance.
